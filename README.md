# Data-Visualization

<p>While performing data analysis visualizing the data is very important or let's say it adds more meaning to the data obtained from EDA (Exploratory data analysis).
Data can be visualized in different format like bar-graph, pie-chart, scatter-plots, histogram, cat-plots and many more to mention. And each of them can be used on the basis of their speciality or purposes. Like count-plots are used to count the number of items that lie in a same category, scatter-plots are used to see the relation/coorelation between the datsets etc.
